Problem Statement:
You have responses of students who wanted to pursue their career as a Data Scientist and Data Analyst. 
Your job is to create a dashboard for the operations team to understand the responses recently received 
from the students with respect to their career interest.

For SQL & PBI you can use the same set of questions.

1. Create a slicer for project interest variable
2. Create a slicer for career role
3. Create a slicer for batch number
4. Check the count of Gender in percentage
5. Check the % ratio for each project interest and career role
6. Check the total count of unique responses received
7. Check the total responses received
8. Check what are the total batch count
9. Add your own flavour of ideas in the dashboard and queries
